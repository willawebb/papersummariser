Simple program to get the summary on the latest computer vision preprints from arXiv.

This program can also retrieve images from within the PDF of the paper for further analysis.

Unfortunately OpenAI doesn't currently provide an image ingestion service that one could use
for image recognition and description; however, the utility is obvious and would be simple to
implement.
